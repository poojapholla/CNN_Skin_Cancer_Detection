## General Information
Deep Neural Network project for given a image, detect if is part of any 9 classes of skin cancer images.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Post data sugmentation and correcting data imbalance, we are able to get the model which is a good fit to detect the images.
